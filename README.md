# Fake News Detection Project

Project is mainly focused on fake news detection using several Deep Learning techniques, comparing them, and visualizing the final outputs in order to understand the semmantics that are extracted from the text.

Project is split into 4 main activities planned.

1. Testing with at least 4 different techniques.
2. Comparison between the models performances.
3. (Maybe) Validation with other datasets.
